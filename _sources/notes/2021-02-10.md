# Missing Data 2: 

## Graph theory foundation

- A DAG
- shapes are nodes
  - nodes generally represent a random variable
- nodes are connected with edges
  - edges may be directed (with an arrow)
- path is a sequence of edges
- a cycle is a path that returns to a given node twice
- we will focus on acyclic graphs
- directed edges connect parent nodes to child nodes (follwoign the arrow)
- Why graphs: useful representation of joint distribtions
- d-connected: two nodes are d-connected if there is a connected path without a collider
- d-separation: independent through a collider

- collider is when arrows flip

## Missingness graphs

- x,y are variables
- Y^* is a proxy for y
- R_y : causal mechanism for missingness of y*

## Recoverabiilty for MCAR



## Discussion

- proxy
- example with ocean data temp sensor, cloud cover images
