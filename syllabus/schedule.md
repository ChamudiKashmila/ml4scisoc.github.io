# Schedule

We will meet synchronously via Zoom: Tu 5:30-8:15

This course will proceed in three main parts: overview, deep dives, and wrap up.


## Overview

In the first part of the course we will review ML basics, set norms for interaction and complete a survey of the topics that we will cover for the rest of the semester.  

In this part of the class, Professor Brown will lead synchronous sessions.  Students will be responsible for reading overviews, refreshing background material, and choosing an area for their course project. Students will start with an introductory demo or replication as a mini project.

## Deep Dives

During the middle of the course we will spend one week on each topic. There will be 1-3 papers to read each week.

Students will be responsible for presenting papers in class on a rotating basis.

During this time students will have milestones where they need to complete interim steps for their course project. The first milestone will be a proposal that includes the specific products for the remainder of the milestones based on a template.  


## Conclusion

In the end of the course, we will focus on integrating ideas across multiple topics.

We will also workshop students' projects, giving substantive feedback prior to the final submissions.

Final projects will be evaluated through a presentation and paper
