# Learning Outcomes and Evaluation


This course has goals with respect to the knowledge and research skills.  

Evaluation will be with respect to each of the outcomes and based on a level of mastery: general awareness, competency, or mastery.


By the end of the course students will be able to:
- Critique common ways that social or scientific applications of ML require violating ML algorithm assumptions and ways to mitigate or adapt.
- Evaluate ML Research papers for their applicability to scientific and social applications of ML.
- Communicate about ML and its limitations work to varied audiences
- Apply ML to scientific and social data responsibly



## Activities

- reading and evaluating ML research papers
- facilitating and participating in class discussions of the papers
- producing a replication, demo, or illustration of one concept covered for a broader audience
- completing a project using ML in a scientific or social domain
- writing a CS conference style (short & concise) final paper on the project
<!-- - reflect on methodologies used in this type of research -->

<!-- - joint annotated bibliography -->

## Evaluation

The grading scheme is rooted in achieving the learning outcomes and is holistic rather than averaged over a number of activities.  A more detailed rubric will be provided soon, in this space.

### Presentation and participation

Presenting papers and participating in class will contribute to demonstrating a basic awareness at each of learning objective. Active participation and presentations will be evaluated and feedback will be provided after each presentation and regularly on other participation.


### Translation mini project

For this assignment you can choose any topic other than the one your project is for and produce a short demo, illustration, or replication that makes some aspect of the the topic.

For this, you must submit a one paragraph proposal by the Friday after we cover that topic in class.  Once that's approved that it will count, you have two weeks to build your demo or replication. The latest your demo may be submitted is at the same time as your final project.

<!-- Grading of individual items will be on a basis of mastery:
 - 0: not submitted or too incomplete to assess
 - 1: sincere attempt, general awareness of the skill/topic
 - 2: competent, sound understanding, but not too deep of a topic able to complete apply a skill with instruction
 - 3: -->
