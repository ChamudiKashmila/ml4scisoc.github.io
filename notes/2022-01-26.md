## Admin

- sorry about notes
- private github repo --> Spring 2022
- grading contract FYI 
    - Will be given further instructions on ways to achieve an 'A' or 'B'
        - To get a 'B' you will only need to complete the paper and presentation
        - To get an 'A' you will implement a project (translation)
    - Paper and presentation will be assigned
        - Paper --> CS Conference Style
        - Draft due: last day before the presentation, will be posted for the class to review


## Opening Question 

What kind of data are you most in working with?

- Class response:
    - GIS data
    - Linguistic data (tweets, reddit posts)
    - Numerical data (tabular)
    - Video/Image
    - Time series 
    - EHR/Medical related data
    - NLP
    - tabular/survey
    

## How to Read a Paper


## Model Based ML
- Discrete probabilities (distributions introduced in murder mystery chapter)
- Bernoulli
- Priors (probablistic guess about a random variable)
    - Are useful for working with less data to create strong inferences
        - Working with things when not a lot of data is available
    - Assumptions, expressed in a probability distribution
- Posterior
    - Inference given regularizer: Likelihood...
    - Most common posterior probability distribution we're doing: Probability of parameters given data
- Point Estimate
    - This are the single values produced after training (weights)
    - Posterior mean
![example of point estimate](/images/pointEstimate.svg)

- Most of the probability distributions we'll use belong to the exponential family 
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family
- Conditional Probability
    - One for each value of the conditioning variable
    - (e.g.) Murder mystery --> murderer variable can be Grey or Auburn
![example marginal distribution from murder mystery text](/images/marginalDistribution.svg)

- Marginal probability
    - (Section 1.2 -- A Model of Murder)
    - "Probability of one event in the presence of all (or subset) outcomes of the other random variable..." (https://machinelearningmastery.com/joint-marginal-and-conditional-probability-for-machine-learning/)
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
    - Assume a distribution, our goal will be to find the theta (parameter)
    - Maximizing, find parameters that will give us the highest probability (finding the one--parameter--that fits best)
- elicitation - study of how to elicit...


## Prepare for next class
- Order of the weekly topics may change
- Dr. Brown will present next week, but we'll start rotating the following week
- There are (2) readings, bring questions and prepare

### Learning & Evaluation

- Read through the whole Learning and Evaluation Page after I post a notification to, there are some fixes to be made
- Bring Questions to class next week
- Be ready to work on your grading contract

### Reading

The Scientific Method in the Science of Machine Learning and Value-laden Disciplinary Shifts in Machine Learning
