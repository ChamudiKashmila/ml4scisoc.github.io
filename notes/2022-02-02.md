Roles for Computing in Social Change
-concerns about fairness, bias and accountability in the field


Introduction:
- high stakes decision making algorithms have potential to predict outcomes more accurately
- cs has generally failed to target the correct point of intervention
- ex: intervention at the selection phase in an employment context could prevent a hostile work place

Computing as a Diagnostic
- computing can help us measure social problems and diagnose how they manifest in tech systems
- computing cannot solve issues on its own
- Diagnostics work can be valuable
    - highlight tech dimensions of social problems
- misinformation can negatively affect marginalized populations more ex: search engines displaying low quality health information

- not presented as solutions, rather as tools to document practices
    - not to confuse diagnostics with treatment
    - computing is not unique in helping diagnose social problems
        - sociology, etc..
    - certain tools can be treated as certainity for every situation, which is not the case

Computing as a Formalizer
- computing requires explicit specification of inputs and goals
- these inputs and goals can be affected by transperency, accountability and stake holder participation
    - need to be precise
ex: risk assessment: debate over how to formalize pretrial risk, if and how to use these instruments
- not all data is easy to quantify
- may press people to rely on measures that are incorrect

Computing as Rebuttal
- computing can clarify the limits of technical interventions and of policies promised on them
- limits of computing can drive people to reject computational approaches
- ex: using an algorithm to determine an immigrant's societal worth, not good. Should seek a different method rather than forcing a technological one
- need to understand what algorithms are actually capable of, instead of forcing it on everything
    - need to show what an algorithm CANT do (prove limits)
- prediction algorithms for risk assessment
- computational research on fairness is built on discrimination law
- Risks
    - proclomations of what a computational tool is incapable of may focus on improving tool even if it is not possible

Computing as a Synecdoche
- computing can foreground long standing social problems in a new way
- Eubank's core concern: computing is just one mechanism through which longstanding poverty policy is manifested
- Automated systems can divert poor people from the resources they need
- computing can help bring attention to old problems, however

- synecdochal focus on computing must walk a pragmatic line between over emphasis on tech aspects and recognition of the work tech actually does
- need to find a balance between the two and develop better systems with more emphasis on social issues
