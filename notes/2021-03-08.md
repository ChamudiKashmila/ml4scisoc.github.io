# Latent Variable Models: GMM & Topic Models


## Gaussian Mixture models

- key points:
  - model versus algorithm
- algorithm:
  - initialize
  - Estep
  - Mstep
  - until convergence:
    - parameters stop changing, assignments stop changing
- Covariance types:
  - covers weakness in kmeans


## Topic Models

- corpora: collection of documents
- text modeling, was classically binary matrices
  - also tf-idf
  - useful for dicsriminating docuemtns,
  - lacks meaning
- pLSI: probabilistic, latent semantic indexing
  - reminiscnet of GMM
  - assumes exchangeability
  - mixutre components
