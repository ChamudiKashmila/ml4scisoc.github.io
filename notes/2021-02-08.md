# Class 4: Missing Data: Basic techniques


## Evaluation of missing data at training

- mulitple imputation
- ML based was better than imputation which is better than dropping samples
- example datasets: 45% of patients have at least 1 missing value

### Imputation

- Mean imputation:
  - insert the mean based onthe other values
- Hot deck
  - mean-like with similarity
- Multiple inputation
  - 3 diff ways


### Imputation ML

- MLP
  - fully connected
- Self organization
  - competitive learning
  - NN on modle of nodes in 2d grid,
- KNN
  - select closest complete case to impute values from
  - expensive for large datasets due to need to search everywhere for each missing value


### Testing

- Train NN based on data imputed with each technie

Conclusions:
- in general, any imputation was better than deletion
- ML based performed better


### Discussion  & Questions

- interesting that even simple methods provide improvement
- SOM is sort of unclear how does that work?
- Review of MLP  and [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)

##  Handling missing values At application time

- reduced models vs imputation.
- broad approach
- 15 common datasets

### Techniques:
- Discard
- Acquire missing values
- Imputation
  - predictive value imputation
  - distribution based
  - unique values
- Reduced Feature Models
  - retrain for different feature models


Feature imputability impacts the distribution or predictive type of imputation

### More complex model

- decision tree with bagging
- again, reduced model is the best strategy


### Hybrid Models for efficient prediction

- reduced models
- a hybrid is a complete model with stored subset for most common missing features
- Reduced feature enseble
  - N models for N features
  - each one is missing one feature
  - average these together for final prediction
  - substantial reduction in when there is a single feature is missing
  - combine with  imputation for multiple features
  - relative accuracy is better than imputation

### General takeaways

- reduced models vs imputatation is  a large improvement
- this is sort of an imputation

### Weaknesses

- Didn't check unique value imputation
- MCAR
- focused on

## Overall Discussion

- How might the two problems interact?
  - if missing data at both train and prediction...
  - train using missing data without imputation for training the separate models

- Questions on these ideas

- What additional things might you need to consider when choosing one?
  - feature imputability at training

- what to do with time series data
- How to check if missing CAR?
  - look at collection technique
  -

- what do to with varying data per person
  - LSTM for time series data
  - hierarchichal modeling other wise
  - [example of hierarchical with time series also](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.232.390&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
